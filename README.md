# TagRec_Plus_Plus_TKDE

Code for our TKDE submission. A taxonomy attention network for categorizing questions to hierarchical learning taxonomy.

We propose a novel cross-attention mechanism which is efficient by sampling only relevant tags for computign cross-attention. The tags sampled approximate the attention well as shown by our theoretical bounds for the same derived using lispchitz continuity principle.
